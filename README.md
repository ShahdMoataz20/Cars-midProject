The used car market is a dynamic sector influenced by various factors, including vehicle age, condition, mileage, manufacturer, and regional market differences. Understanding these factors is crucial for stakeholders such as sellers, buyers, and market analysts to make informed decisions. 

**Dataset Overview**

The dataset comprises approximately 500,000 used vehicle entries from Craigslist across the United States, encompassing 26 associated attributes. These attributes include price, condition, manufacturer, model, year, fuel type, odometer reading, transmission, drive type, and location details. 

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  * Missing Values: Columns with significant missing values were dropped, and remaining missing values in other columns were addressed 
    appropriately.
  
  * Data Types: Ensured correct data types for each column to facilitate accurate analysis.
  
  * Duplicates: Removed duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   1- Price Distribution: The majority of vehicle prices are below $25,000, with a significant concentration under $10,000.

   2- Manufacturer Analysis:
     * Top manufacturers by listing frequency include Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan.
     * Luxury brands like Porsche and Tesla have higher average prices compared to other manufacturers.
         
   3- Vehicle Age vs. Price: A negative correlation exists between vehicle age and price, indicating that older vehicles tend to have lower prices.

   4- Odometer Reading Analysis: Higher odometer readings generally correspond to lower vehicle prices, suggesting that cars with more mileage are 
         less expensive.

     * Automatic transmissions are more prevalent than manual ones.
     * Vehicles with manual transmissions have a slightly lower average price compared to automatic ones.
